# Meta: Back-End Developer Capstone

‚ñ∑ This is the culminating project for the Meta Backend Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera.

In this project, I delved into several key areas of back-end development, including database management, API design, authentication, and performance optimization. By solving real-world problems and applying best practices from the industry, I‚Äôve strengthened my skills in designing and deploying back-end solutions tailored to the demands of modern applications.

Thank you for taking the time to review this project! I hope it serves as an inspiration and provides valuable insights to other aspiring back-end developers on their journey in the dynamic field of software development.
